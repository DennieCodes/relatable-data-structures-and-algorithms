# Relatable Data Structures and Algorithm

A project inspired by my experience after a recent interview where I asked for some advice and was advised to study data structures and to try and understand why and when to use each particular data structure.  Although this is a pretty common piece of advice given out to newer engineers, the person who shared this also gave an example of how knowing this has made real world impacts on things that he has worked on at a business level.

His example was a eureka moment for me and suddenly I found newfound interest in studying data structures and algorithms because I saw them from a more macro, organizational, and business level perspective.  Data structures and Algorithms can not only serve to solve coding challenges, but help an organization translate code into increasing productivity, efficiency, decreased need for processing power and time, and overall just be more competitive.

I realized the key was in making these concepts relatable which is why I have started this project.  Instead of studying data structures and algorithms as abstract concepts I want to challenge myself to study them in relatable real world scenarios.
